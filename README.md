========
teaRex is an Angular shopping cart app made as a class project during the Galvanize full stack web development program.

teaRex uses Angular to create a single page shopping cart application which allows users to dynamically search, filter, and shop for items being parsed from a .json file.

Materialize is used on the front end to beautifully tie it all together.
